Whoso list to hunt, I know where is an hind,But as for me, alas, I may no more.The vain travail hath wearied me so sore,I am of them that farthest cometh behind.Yet may I by no means my wearied mindDraw from the deer, but as she fleeth aforeFainting I follow. I leave off therefore,Since in a net I seek to hold the wind.Who list her hunt, I put him out of doubt,As well as I may spend his time in vain.And graven with diamonds in letters plainThere is written, her fair neck round about:“Noli me tangere, for Caesar’s I am,And wild for to hold, though I seem tame.”

Whoso list: whoever wantsHind: Female deerNoli me tangere: “Don’t touch me”
